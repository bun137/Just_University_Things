/*What if itâ€™s the opposite, you try to receive one more value than you actually get?
At this point, your code will deadlock, like so: fatal error: all goroutines are asleep - deadlock!. Your code will never finish as that value will never arrive.

The lesson here is that you need to keep track of how many results you might get and only try to receive that many.*/
