Difference between Sequencial approach vs Concurrent approach vs Parallel approach:

Imagine you need to prepare dinner for 5 guests.

Sequential approach: This is the classic "one thing at a time" approach.
You chop vegetables, then cook them, then prepare meat, and then assemble the final dish.
This takes the longest time (like a single Go routine executing instructions sequentially).

Concurrent approach: You try to juggle tasks to appear more efficient.
You start chopping vegetables while the pot heats up.
You marinate the meat while the vegetables cook.
You assemble the plates while the meat finishes. 
This feels faster than sequential, but tasks aren't truly simultaneous 
(like Go routines using channels to communicate and switch execution).

Parallel approach: If you have 5 kitchens (like 5 CPU cores),
you could assign each task to a separate kitchen. 
All tasks happen at the same time, leading to the fastest completion 
(like running multiple Go routines truly simultaneously on different cores).
However, not all tasks benefit from parallelism due to dependencies or limitations.

Key differences:

Execution: Concurrency allows tasks to overlap in appearance, while parallelism ensures true simultaneous execution.
Resources: Concurrency works on a single CPU, while parallelism leverages multiple CPUs.
Complexity: Concurrency can be complex due to coordination and potential race conditions,
while parallelism might be simpler but resource-dependent.

Go and concurrency: Go excels at concurrency with lightweight goroutines and channels for communication. 
While true parallelism depends on available cores, Go effectively manages concurrent tasks,
improving responsiveness and resource utilization.

Remember: Both concurrency and parallelism have their uses. 
Choose the right approach based on your program's needs and resource constraints.
